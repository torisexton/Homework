## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

```{r}
 # Create a matrix
thismatrix <- matrix(c(7,2,9,4,12,13), nrow = 2, ncol = 3)

# Print the matrix
thismatrix

 # Create a matrix
 thismatrix2 <- matrix(c(1,2,3,7,8,9,12,13,14,19,20,21), nrow = 3, ncol = 4)
 
 # Print the matrix
 thismatrix2
```
```{r}
c(thismatrix) * thismatrix2
```

```{r}

```

```{r}

```{r}

```{r}

```{r}
